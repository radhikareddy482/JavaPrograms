ArrayList provides the facility of random access because it is index-based.
A lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list. Thus, manipulation is slow in the Java ArrayList class.
//public class ArrayList<E> extends AbstractList<E> implements List<E>, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable
public class ArrayListExample {
	

}
